# ðŸš€ GitOps CI/CD with Jenkins

This project demonstrates how to implement a full CI/CD pipeline using *Jenkins* and *GitOps* best practices. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications using Git as the single source of truth.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this project, I implemented a Jenkins-driven CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, tests, and deploys a Dockerized application. The pipeline is fully defined using a Jenkinsfile, making the process repeatable and easy to manage through Git version control.

## âœ… What I Did

1. *Configured a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline* using a declarative Jenkinsfile to automate build, test, and deployment stages.
2. *Integrated GitOps methodology* by managing pipeline logic and deployments through Git commits.
3. *Built and pushed Docker images* to a container registry as part of the CI process.
4. *Automated deployment process* triggered by changes in the Git repository, enabling continuous delivery.
